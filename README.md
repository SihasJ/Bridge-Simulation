**Bridge Parameters:**
- Base mass: $m = 1 \times 10^5 \text{ kg}$
- Stiffness: $k = 3.6 \times 10^6 \text{kg/s}^{2}$
- Initial damping: $c = 1.2 \times 10^4 \text{ kg/s}$
- Natural frequency: $f_n = \frac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \text{ Hz}$

**Mathematical Model:**
The simulation uses convolution to solve the second-order differential equation:
$$m\ddot{x} + c\dot{x} + kx = F(t)$$

The impulse response $G(s)$ is determined based on the discriminant:
- **Overdamped ($\Delta > 0$):** Two real roots
- **Critically damped ($\Delta = 0$):** Repeated real root
- **Underdamped ($\Delta < 0$):** Complex conjugate roots (oscillatory)

**Output:** Multiple plots showing maximum lateral displacement as a function of each parameter, with natural frequency markers for resonance analysis.

## Key Results

The sensitivity analysis (`sens_analysis.m`) reveals important insights:

1. **Resonance Effects:** Maximum vibrations occur when gait frequency approaches the bridge's natural frequency
2. **Damping Impact:** Higher damping significantly reduces vibration amplitude, especially in the underdamped regime
3. **Crowd Effects:** Increasing pedestrian count increases both mass and forcing, leading to complex vibration behavior
4. **Synchronization:** Marching (synchronized) walking produces significantly higher vibrations than normal (random phase) walking

## Technical Details

### Convolution Method
The simulations use discrete convolution to compute the system response:
$$x(t) = \text{conv}(F(t), G(t)) \cdot dt$$
where:
- $F(t)$ is the forcing function
- $G(t)$ is the impulse response (Green's function)
- $dt$ is the time step for proper scaling

### Finite Difference Scheme
The wave equation uses a central difference scheme:
$$u(i,j+1) = \frac{42}{25}u(i,j) + \frac{4}{25}\left(u(i-1,j) + u(i+1,j)\right) - u(i,j-1)$$

### Superposition Principle
For multiple pedestrians, individual forces are summed:
$$F_s = \sum_{i=1}^{N} r_i(t + \phi_i)$$
where $\phi_i$ is the random gait phase for each pedestrian.

- Fourier series comparisons
- Wave propagation surfaces
- Sensitivity analysis curves
- Resonance frequency markers

## Notes

- All time steps ($dt$) and spatial steps ($dx$) are chosen to ensure numerical stability
- The sensitivity analysis uses Monte Carlo-style random phase generation for realistic pedestrian behavior
- Results are sensitive to the chosen parameter ranges; adjust in `sens_analysis.m` as needed

## Future Improvements

- Interactive parameter tuning interface
- Additional damping models (non-linear, frequency-dependent)
- Real-time visualization capabilities
- Export functionality for simulation data
- Extended sensitivity analysis for additional parameters
- Integration with structural analysis software
